# Requirements to run
1) *ISET cam:* https://github.com/ISET/isetcam
2) *ISET Lens:*  https://github.com/ISET/isetlens
3) *ISET 3D:*  https://github.com/ISET/iset3d

# Structure

## Generate Ray Transfer Functions
Run *generateRTFfromzemax.m*



## Generate Relative illuminations figures
Run *generateRellIllumFigures.m*

## Generate Edge spread function figures
Run *generateESFFigures.m*


## Zemax macro
The zemax macro used for dataset generation can be found in the 'zemax' directory.
The macro was written by Jamyuen Ko (Google).

## Data
### ESF
This directory contains edge and linespread functions calculated using zemax for all lenses that were tested
### zemaxraytrace
This directory contains all txt files generated by the zemax macro.
Unzip first.

### rtf
This folder contains all generated ray transfer functions 

### Relativeillumination-pbrt
Mat files containing the relative illuminations calculated using zemax.
