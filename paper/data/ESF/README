The ESF mat files were generated using the "Geometric Linepread/EdgeSpread" function in ZEMAX.
This feature disregards the contribution of diffraction which is not modeled in the RTF.


The mat files contain a matrix with five columns [position, LSF X, ESF X, LSF Y, ESF Y].
We make a distinction between X and Y because, off-axis, the edge spread function is different for horizontal of vertical edges
