The ESF mat files were generated using the "Geometric Linepread/EdgeSpread" function in ZEMAX.
This feature disregards the contribution of diffraction which is not modeled in the RTF.

The MAT file contains a cell array, each cell corresponds to to a different condition for which the ESF was calculated
Each cell contains a matrix with five columns [position, LSF X, ESF X, LSF Y, ESF Y].
We make a distinction between X and Y because, off-axis, the edge spread function is different for horizontal of vertical edges


For the lenses in the paper, the ESF is calculated on axis at two distances from the lens.


Lens    - distances
dgauss - 1 m, 1.2 m
inv. telephoteo - 3 m, 4.0 cm
petzval - 3 m, 3.5 m
Cooke - 0.3m , 0.5m
Tessar - 1.3m - 2.0 m
wide angle lens  - 3.0 m , 0.1 m
